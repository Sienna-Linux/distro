An opinionated tweaked [ublue](https://universal-blue.org/) image based on [silverblue-main](https://github.com/ublue-os/main/pkgs/container/silverblue-main).

## What is this?

This is my own tweaked [bootable container](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/getting-started/) deployment that I maintain for myself. It's mainly focused on 3D graphics, programming and gaming workloads.

If anyone is using this image please reach out with a bug report so I don't randomly change things on your computer.

## Installation

1. You first need a [Fedora Atomic Desktop](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/) installed.
2. Then you rebase with these commands

### Commands:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/polycatdev/bluecat:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/polycatdev/bluecat:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
